## Configuration Manager Install


<a name="section-1">

## THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD

From the command line / bash go the root directory that was setup in the last set of instructions you can find here: [Server Setup](/docs/{{version}}/server-setup)

Make sure your private key is added to the server for the bitbucket repo. on windows run the following commands after you upload or copy your private key to ~ /.ssh/

```bash
# In .ssh folder make sure you chmod your private key 600
sudo chmod 600 {private.key.file}
ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent)"

ssh-add {private.key.file}
```
If your site directory is not empty then remove everything from it. 

Now from that empty site doc root directory run this command

```bash
git clone ssh://git@p-bitbucket.imovetv.com/aa/configuration_manager.git ./
```
Once that is done run this command but make sure you have the correct root directory. In my case its the /cm/

```bash
sudo find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 777 {} \; && sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/cm/storage

```


If the MYSQL DB is setup and ready to go then you want copy the code below and save it to a .env file in the root of the main directory.

sudo chmod -Rf 777 /var/www/html/cm/bootstrap
